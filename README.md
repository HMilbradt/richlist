# The Rich List

[The Rich List](areyourich.ca) is a student project created by Harrison Milbradt.

### About This Project

Presented as an alternative to writing a PHP midterm exam, this project designed, developed, tested, and deployed
within 2 days.  The purpose of the project was to earn $1 online, which required some backend development with PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com), end to end encryption, and payment integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca).

### What It Does

The Rich List takes payments from users, in exchange for a spot on the list.  Only the top 10 paying users are shown, with the wop user having their profile picture displayed as well.  

Example:

>Mary is a new user who wants to be #1 in the list.  Bob occupies the top spot, and has $10 in his account.  Mary pays $10.01, taking the top spot, and shifting Bob down to the #2 spot.
